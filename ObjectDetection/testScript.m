% TRAIN NETWORK
% The network requires input images of size 224-by-224-by-3, but the images in the image datastores have different sizes.
% Use an augmented image datastore to automatically resize the training images.
% Specify additional augmentation operations to perform on the training images: randomly flip the training images along the vertical axis, and randomly translate them up to 30 pixels horizontally and vertically.
% Data augmentation helps prevent the network from overfitting and memorizing the exact details of the training images.

pixelRange = [-30 30];
imageAugmenter = imageDataAugmenter( ...
    'RandXReflection',true, ...
    'RandXTranslation',pixelRange, ...
    'RandYTranslation',pixelRange);
augimdsTrain = augmentedImageDatastore(inputSize(1:2),imdsTrain, ...
    'DataAugmentation',imageAugmenter);

% To automatically resize the validation images without performing further data augmentation, 
% use an augmented image datastore without specifying any additional preprocessing operations.
augimdsValidation = augmentedImageDatastore(inputSize(1:2),imdsValidation);

% Specify the training options. For transfer learning, keep the features from the early layers of the pretrained network (the transferred layer weights).
% To slow down learning in the transferred layers, set the initial learning rate to a small value.
% In the previous step, you increased the learning rate factors for the fully connected layer to speed up learning in the new final layers.
% This combination of learning rate settings results in fast learning only in the new layers and slower learning in the other layers.
% When performing transfer learning, you do not need to train for as many epochs.
% An epoch is a full training cycle on the entire training data set.
% Specify the mini-batch size and validation data.
% The software validates the network every ValidationFrequency iterations during training.

% Train the network consisting of the transferred and new layers. By default, trainNetwork uses a GPU if one is available.
